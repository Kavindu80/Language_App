# Letter Screens Fix

This directory contains scripts to fix screen refresh issues and navigation problems in the WordsStartingWith letter screens of the English Alphabet learning app.

## Problem Fixed

The scripts in this directory address two main issues:

1. **Screen refresh issues** - Previously, clicking sound buttons in letter screens caused the entire interface to refresh/flicker
2. **Empty blue screens** - Navigating during audio playback could lead to empty blue screens

## Solution Implemented

All letter screens (A-Z) have been fixed with the following optimizations:

- **Performance Improvements**
  - Word arrays moved outside component to prevent re-creation
  - `useRef` for animation values instead of creating new ones each render
  - Refs for state tracking to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - `useCallback` for all functions to prevent recreation
  - Memoized render functions for better performance
  - `removeClippedSubviews={true}` for ScrollView

- **UI Enhancements**
  - Visual feedback during audio playback
  - Disabled buttons during audio playback
  - Smooth animations and transitions

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Navigation protection during audio playback (prevents empty blue screens)
  - Proper hardware back button handling
  - Proper audio state cleanup on component unmount
  - Scroll disabling during audio playback

## Scripts

- **fix-all-screens.js** - Automated script that fixes all letter screens (D-F, H-M, O-Z)
- **fix-all-screens.bat** - Windows batch file to run the script
- **implementation-guide.md** - Detailed guide explaining the implementation
- **fix-letter-screens.sh** - Helper script to locate letter screen files
- **fix-remaining-screens.js** - Template code for fixing letter screens

## Usage

To automatically fix all remaining letter screens:

```
# Windows
scripts\fix-all-screens.bat

# Or with Node.js directly
cd scripts
node fix-all-screens.js
```

## Verification

After running the fix scripts, verify each letter screen with these checks:

1. Screen doesn't refresh when clicking sound buttons
2. Audio plays correctly with visual feedback
3. Navigation is blocked during audio playback
4. Back button is handled properly
5. Continue button is disabled during audio playback

## Backup

The script automatically creates backups of all original files with the `.backup` extension.
